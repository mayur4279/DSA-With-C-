// It tells us include all the code file from iostream header file, 
// which provide objects like ( cout, cin, endl ) to print data in terminal 
#include <iostream>   
using namespace std;   // We don't want to use std::cout every time thsta why we are using this   
// namespace is the collection of (variables, functions, classes, objects)
// Single Line of code is a { statement } 
// group of statement create { functions }
// group of functions and variables create a { class }  
// Similary collection of { classes, objects, functions, variables} are create { namespace }


// Every C++ Program Has its main function 
// we are using int because we are returing 0 at the end for checking code is properly working or not
// we are using  the cout object from  std namespace  
// total 95 keyword in c++  (like int )      

int  main()  {                         // creating function  with name ( main ) 
    cout  <<  "hello world!" ;  
    return 0; 
}

// ( << )  ---> Insertion Operator  
// It is used to formate the according to its data type  & then send it to the cout object 



// In c++ We have Three (3) Types of Loops 
// while loop   
// do while loop  
// for loop  
// In loops The condition Became false then the loops are terminated.   



// We Have 2 types of conditional Statement  
// if,  else if, else   
// switch  statement  


// Function in C++  
// In Function We can reuse our code any point of time  as well 


// Operator Overloading is the advance Topic to learn this video did'nt gave us the detailed info
